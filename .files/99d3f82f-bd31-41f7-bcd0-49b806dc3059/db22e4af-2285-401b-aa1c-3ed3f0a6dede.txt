A FEW NOTES ON PH Ở
Ph ở is so often mispronounced that I think it’s worth including a brief
tutorial here. If you say it as if it rhymes in this sentence—“I fo’ sho’ want
some ph ở ”—re ad on. Ph ở is pronounced “fuh,” as in “fun,” with an
inquiring inflection at the end. Practice this, and you’ll impress all the
Vietnamese servers at the ph ở  restaurants when you order in perfect
Vietnamese.
USING THE NOODLE
I grew up on dried noodle packages, but some cooks swear by the fresh
ones. Prepare them the same way you would the dry packaged noodles,
except reduce the amount of time they steep in hot water to just 1 minute.
You’ll see the majority of ph ở  bowls using the small-width rice noodles, but
my mam a always made ph ở  with a slightly wider , medium-width noodle.
She was born in northern Vietnam, where ph ở  originate d, and it’s
traditional to use a slightly wider noodle in the soup. So as a tribute to my
mama, I, too, always serve my ph ở  with medium-width rice noodles. Look
for an M on the packag e, which indicates a medium noodle, or, if you
prefer , an S for small. Ther e is not much difference; it’s really a matter of
preference. Neve r, however , use noodles marked L for ph ở ; large-width rice
noodles are generally used for stir-fried dishes such as Soy Sauce Stir-Fried
Noodles .
