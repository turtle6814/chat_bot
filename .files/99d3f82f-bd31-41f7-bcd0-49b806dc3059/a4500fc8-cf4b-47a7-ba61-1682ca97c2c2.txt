MY LAST MEAL
The Sixth Course
After a feast of fried dishes, I know I’d crave something light and
brothy. A noodle soup would taste  so-o-o-o good. My favorites are
ph ở and ramen—the authentic Japanese kind with a broth made
from pork and chicken bones simmer ed for hours, not the instant,
10-for -a-dollar packages from the grocery store. If I had to choose
between them, I’d have to stick to my r oots and pick ph ở.
Because making ph ở is a rather elaborate undertaking, my
mama would make enough  to fill a 10-quart pot whenever she
decided to make it. Even though there were just three of us in the
house, that huge pot of soup would last for only 2 or 3 days. it was
that good. I vividly remember the weekend mornings when I would
awaken to the familiar fragrance of ph ở ; it meant that I’d be eating
really well that day, and for several days after that. I prefer my ph ở
straight, without garnishes except for a lime wedge , which I
squeeze the juice from before taking that first sip. Occasionally ,
though, I treat myself to a few additions:  hanh tran (the white parts
of the scallion blanched in hot ph ở broth) or  hành giãm (thin slices
of onion with a dash of vinegar). Both of these add a nice
harmonious zing when eaten with the meat.
