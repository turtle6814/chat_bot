MY MAMA ’S CHICKEN NOODLE
SOUP
There is nothing like a steaming hot bowl of this noodle
soup on a cold winter day. But ph ở  is not just one of those things I love to
eat when the frost is settling on the leaves outside; it is simply one of my
favorite dishes ever. It doesn’t matter if it’s a scalding Houston summer
afternoon—I’ll still gladly sweat over my bowl of ph ở .
My mam a made the best ph ở  I’d ever had in my life. And I’m not just
saying that because she was my mama. It was so good that her friends used
to constantly ur ge her to open a noodle shop.
Years after she died, when I began trying to piece together her recipes, I
asked my dad about her ph ở . He told me she’d jotted down a list of
ingredients somewhere, but the notes were forever lost.
While my mama  usually made the better -known beef version, it was her
ph ở gà—chicken noodle soup— that I loved more. The stock is lighter in
flavor but still packed with umami. It took me years before I finally
mustered up the courage to try to replicate her recipe. I sometimes still
imagine my mama standing over my shoulder and shaking her head in
disapproval. I can only hope that my version of ph ở  gà, inspired by hers, is
half as good as the soup of my childhood.
You’ll notice that I char the whole onions and piece of ginger and dry-
roast the spices here. In doing so, I am coaxing every bit of sweetness and
flavor from the ingredients, which translates to a more flavorf ul stock. If,
like me, you are an ardent fan of dark meat, use 6 chicken leg quarters in
lieu of a whole chicken.
